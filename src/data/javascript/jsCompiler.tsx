          Programming languages that we use day by day, they are understandable

          computer can't run or execute those directly. So we need some kind of
          program which can translate our code into something that is
          understandable by the computer.

          that computer can run it. Even though they do the same thing but their
          name is different because of the way they do the translation.

            Compiler runs only once. That means it only needs to be compiled
            once. Compiled output can be run directly. This results in faster

            Compilers generate binaries that are optimized for specific target
            platforms (like Windows, macOS, Linux, or embedded devices). So it's
            perfomance and resource usage are optimized. This is essential for
            platforms where performance, resource usage, and battery life are
            critical (like IoT devices or embedded systems).Modern compilers
            like GCC, Clang, and Rust's Cargo apply many optimizations to the
            code, such as dead code elimination, loop unrolling, and inlining
            functions. This improves the overall performance and efficiency of
            the program, reducing memory usage and execution time.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Since a compiled binary does not contain the original source code,
            it's much harder to reverse-engineer than interpreted languages. It
            provides security for proprietary code, making it harder for
            competitors to steal or copy the logic.

          <ListItem>
            Compiled programs don't require an interpreter or external runtime
            to execute. They can be run directly from the compiled binary. It
            eliminates the need for users to install extra software (like Python
            or Node.js) to run your program.

            Compilers perform static analysis and catch errors before execution.
            This includes syntax errors, type errors, and missing variables.This
            reduces runtime errors, and helps you fix issues early in
            development.

            Large codebases with thousands of files take a long time to compile,
            especially with optimization flags enabled. Projects like Linux
            Kernel or Chromium can take hours to compile from source. It slows
            down the development workflow, and developers have to wait for every

            cross-platform development. Developers need to cross-compile or use
            tools like Docker to generate binaries for multiple platforms.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Since the machine code generated by the compiler is hard to read,
            debugging binary files is challenging. If you encounter a
            segmentation fault (like in C/C++), it can be hard to track the
            exact source of the error. Tools like gdb or lldb are necessary to
            debug compiled binaries, but they have a learning curve.

          <ListItem>
            Once a program is compiled, it cannot be modified without
            recompiling the entire source code. This limits the ability to
            iterate quickly on changes. For dynamic applications that require
            code changes during runtime (like web apps), development time is
            increased.

            Compiler can be CPU intensive, which means they can use a lot of
            memory and CPU power. Compilers like GCC and Rust's Cargo are
            resource-hungry, requiring significant CPU and memory usage. This
            can be a problem on low-end machines, making it difficult to compile

            Since there's no need to compile the code, you can run it

            Since interpreters execute code line-by-line, errors are caught

            Since code is executed line-by-line, it's slower than a compiled

            User need to have the interpreter installed on their system. To run
            Python, you need to install the Python interpreter; to run
            JavaScript, you need a browser or Node.js. It adds a dependency, and
            if the interpreter is missing, your code won't run.

            The source code is exposed to users, unlike a compiled binary which

            Since the interpreter is always running alongside the program, it

            Transpiling (short for "source-to-source compiling") is the process

          </Typography>
          , typically at the same or a similar level of abstraction as the
          source code. It doesn't convert the source code to machine code. The
          primary purpose of transpilation is to enable developers to use newer
          features or syntaxes not supported in the target environment, or to
          convert code into a more widely supported language for portability and
          interoperability.

          The transpiling process is similar to the compiling process but with
          some key differences. While it also involves lexical analysis, syntax
          analysis, and semantic analysis, it typically does not include an
          optimization phase. Instead, it focuses on transforming the source
          code into an equivalent representation in the target language.

          The concept of transpiling has been present since the early days of
          programming, with one of the earliest examples being Digital
          Research's XLT86 in 1981, which translated Intel 8080 assembly code to
          Intel 8086 assembly code.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          In the context of JavaScript, the evolution of the language led to the
          development of transpilers to bridge compatibility gaps. For instance,
          as new ECMAScript standards introduced modern JavaScript features,
          tools like Babel were created to transpile ES6+ code into ES5,
          ensuring compatibility with older browsers.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Tools like Sass (for CSS) and CoffeeScript (for JavaScript) introduced
          the concept of writing in a higher-level or more ergonomic syntax and
          converting it to widely-supported formats. TypeScript transpiles to
          JavaScript, enabling developers to benefit from type checking and
          modern features while targeting different JavaScript versions. These
          tools were especially popular for frontend development, as they
          streamlined workflows for styling and scripting.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          JSX (for React) was introduced to bridge the gap between JavaScript
          and React, enabling developers to write React components in JSX.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Transpilers have played a crucial role in the adoption of modern
          programming practices, allowing developers to write code using the
          latest language features while maintaining compatibility across
          diverse environments.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          In essence, transpiling arose as a practical solution to challenges
          posed by the rapid evolution of programming languages, diverse runtime
          environments, and the growing complexity of software applications. It
          has since become a critical part of modern development workflows.

          At the start of program execution, a Global Execution Context (GEC) is
          created. As the program runs, if a function invocation is encountered
          (like first()), a Function Execution Context (FEC) is created on top
          of the Global Execution Context. While executing the statements inside
          first(), if another function invocation (like second()) is found, a
          new Function Execution Context is created on top of the previous one.
          This process continues for every function call. Once all the
          statements inside a function are executed, its execution context is
          removed from the call stack, and control returns to the previous
          execution context. This process repeats for each function until all
          execution contexts are cleared. Finally, once all the code is
          executed, the Global Execution Context is also removed from the call
          stack.

          It is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, crucial to understanding
          how asynchronous operations work in the language. It is responsible
          for handling and executing tasks, events, and asynchronous code in a
          non-blocking manner, enabling JavaScript to remain single-threaded
          while handling multiple tasks concurrently.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mode="h6">
          Let's have a look at how the event loop works...
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          JavaScript starts executing synchronous code line by line, pushing
          function calls onto the call stack and popping them off once complete.
          When an asynchronous operation (e.g., setTimeout or a fetch request)
          is encountered, it is handed off to the Web APIs or the Node.js
          equivalent. Once the operation completes, its associated callback is
          added to the appropriate queue. After all microtasks are handled, it
          moves to the callback queue and processes one task at a time.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If the
          stack is empty, the event loop picks the first task from the microtask
          queue (e.g., resolved Promises) and executes it. The event loop
          repeats this process, ensuring JavaScript remains responsive.

        <Typography>Let's learn about different types of scope...</Typography>
        <Typography mode="h6">Global Scope</Typography>
        <Typography>
          In JavaScript, global scope is the widest scope available. Variables
          declared in global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code,
          whether it's inside functions, conditional statements, loops, or other
          blocks of code. You can think of global scope as the "public square"
          of your program, where everyone can see and access what's going on.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Everything you declare in global scope is like putting up a billboard
          in the square for everyone to see. Any function or code block within
          your program can read and modify these global variables.
        </Typography>

        <Typography mode="h6">Local Scope</Typography>
        <Typography>
          Local scope in JavaScript is like a private room within a building â€“
          it's an enclosed space where variables are only accessible from within
          that specific room. When you declare a variable in local scope, it is
          limited in visibility to the block of code, function, or conditional
          statement in which it is defined.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Let's say you've declared variables in a function, now every time the
          function is called, new instances of these variables are created. This
          provides some isolation between functions. Each function call acts in

          environment.
