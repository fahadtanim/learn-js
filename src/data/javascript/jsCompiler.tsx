          Programming languages that we use day by day, they are understandable
          by us. But they are not understandable by the computer. That means
          computer can't run or execute those directly. So we need some kind of
          program which can translate our code into something that is
          understandable by the computer.

        <Typography>
          <Typography mode="b-text">Compiler </Typography> and{' '}
          <Typography mode="b-text"> Interpreter </Typography> are programs
          which is responsible for exactly doing that. They read our code and
          translate it into something that is understandable by the computer. So
          that computer can run it. Even though they do the same thing but their
          name is different because of the way they do the translation.

            Compiler runs only once. That means it only needs to be compiled
            once. Compiled output can be run directly. This results in faster
            execution.

            Compilers generate binaries that are optimized for specific target
            platforms (like Windows, macOS, Linux, or embedded devices). So it's
            perfomance and resource usage are optimized. This is essential for
            platforms where performance, resource usage, and battery life are
            critical (like IoT devices or embedded systems).Modern compilers
            like GCC, Clang, and Rust's Cargo apply many optimizations to the
            code, such as dead code elimination, loop unrolling, and inlining
            functions. This improves the overall performance and efficiency of
            the program, reducing memory usage and execution time.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Since a compiled binary does not contain the original source code,
            it's much harder to reverse-engineer than interpreted languages. It
            provides security for proprietary code, making it harder for
            competitors to steal or copy the logic.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Compiled programs don't require an interpreter or external runtime
            to execute. They can be run directly from the compiled binary. It
            eliminates the need for users to install extra software (like Python
            or Node.js) to run your program.

            Compilers perform static analysis and catch errors before execution.
            This includes syntax errors, type errors, and missing variables.This
            reduces runtime errors, and helps you fix issues early in
            development.

            Large codebases with thousands of files take a long time to compile,
            especially with optimization flags enabled. Projects like Linux
            Kernel or Chromium can take hours to compile from source. It slows
            down the development workflow, and developers have to wait for every
            change to be recompiled.

            Compiled binaries are platform-specific, meaning a program compiled
            for Windows wonâ€™t run on Linux or macOS. A Windows{' '}
            <Pill>.exe </Pill>
            file cannot be executed on macOS or Linux. This complicates
            cross-platform development. Developers need to cross-compile or use
            tools like Docker to generate binaries for multiple platforms.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Since the machine code generated by the compiler is hard to read,
            debugging binary files is challenging. If you encounter a
            segmentation fault (like in C/C++), it can be hard to track the
            exact source of the error. Tools like gdb or lldb are necessary to
            debug compiled binaries, but they have a learning curve.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Once a program is compiled, it cannot be modified without
            recompiling the entire source code. This limits the ability to
            iterate quickly on changes. For dynamic applications that require
            code changes during runtime (like web apps), development time is
            increased.

            Compiler can be CPU intensive, which means they can use a lot of
            memory and CPU power. Compilers like GCC and Rust's Cargo are
            resource-hungry, requiring significant CPU and memory usage. This
            can be a problem on low-end machines, making it difficult to compile

            Since there's no need to compile the code, you can run it

          <ListItem>
            Since interpreters execute code line-by-line, errors are caught
            immediately and provide detailed stack traces. This allows

            Since code is executed line-by-line, it's slower than a compiled

            User need to have the interpreter installed on their system. To run
            Python, you need to install the Python interpreter; to run
            JavaScript, you need a browser or Node.js. It adds a dependency, and
            if the interpreter is missing, your code won't run.

            The source code is exposed to users, unlike a compiled binary which

            Since the interpreter is always running alongside the program, it

          JavaScript is a constantly evolving language, with new features and

          <Typography mode="b-text">
            Transpiling (short for "source-to-source compiling") is the process
            of converting code written in one programming language or syntax to
            an equivalent version in another language or syntax
          </Typography>
          , typically at the same or a similar level of abstraction as the
          source code. It doesn't convert the source code to machine code. The
          primary purpose of transpilation is to enable developers to use newer
          features or syntaxes not supported in the target environment, or to
          convert code into a more widely supported language for portability and
          interoperability.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The transpiling process is similar to the compiling process but with
          some key differences. While it also involves lexical analysis, syntax
          analysis, and semantic analysis, it typically does not include an
          optimization phase. Instead, it focuses on transforming the source
          code into an equivalent representation in the target language.
          <Typography mode="b-text">
            One of the most used example of transpiling is in using TypeScript.

          The concept of transpiling has been present since the early days of
          programming, with one of the earliest examples being Digital
          Research's XLT86 in 1981, which translated Intel 8080 assembly code to
          Intel 8086 assembly code.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          In the context of JavaScript, the evolution of the language led to the
          development of transpilers to bridge compatibility gaps. For instance,
          as new ECMAScript standards introduced modern JavaScript features,
          tools like Babel were created to transpile ES6+ code into ES5,
          ensuring compatibility with older browsers.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Tools like Sass (for CSS) and CoffeeScript (for JavaScript) introduced
          the concept of writing in a higher-level or more ergonomic syntax and
          converting it to widely-supported formats. TypeScript transpiles to
          JavaScript, enabling developers to benefit from type checking and
          modern features while targeting different JavaScript versions. These
          tools were especially popular for frontend development, as they
          streamlined workflows for styling and scripting.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          JSX (for React) was introduced to bridge the gap between JavaScript
          and React, enabling developers to write React components in JSX.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Transpilers have played a crucial role in the adoption of modern
          programming practices, allowing developers to write code using the
          latest language features while maintaining compatibility across
          diverse environments.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          In essence, transpiling arose as a practical solution to challenges
          posed by the rapid evolution of programming languages, diverse runtime
          environments, and the growing complexity of software applications. It
          has since become a critical part of modern development workflows.

          At the start of program execution, a Global Execution Context (GEC) is
          created. As the program runs, if a function invocation is encountered
          (like first()), a Function Execution Context (FEC) is created on top
          of the Global Execution Context. While executing the statements inside
          first(), if another function invocation (like second()) is found, a
          new Function Execution Context is created on top of the previous one.
          This process continues for every function call. Once all the
          statements inside a function are executed, its execution context is
          removed from the call stack, and control returns to the previous
          execution context. This process repeats for each function until all
          execution contexts are cleared. Finally, once all the code is
          executed, the Global Execution Context is also removed from the call
          stack.

        <Typography>
          Event loop is the Javascript's magic mechanism that allows the
          Javascript to act like a multi-threaded languange, even though{' '}
          <Typography mode="b-text">
            it is a single-threaded language.{' '}
          </Typography>
          It is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, crucial to understanding
          how asynchronous operations work in the language. It is responsible
          for handling and executing tasks, events, and asynchronous code in a
          non-blocking manner, enabling JavaScript to remain single-threaded
          while handling multiple tasks concurrently.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mode="h6">
          Let's have a look at how the event loop works...
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          JavaScript starts executing synchronous code line by line, pushing
          function calls onto the call stack and popping them off once complete.
          When an asynchronous operation (e.g., setTimeout or a fetch request)
          is encountered, it is handed off to the Web APIs or the Node.js
          equivalent. Once the operation completes, its associated callback is
          added to the appropriate queue. After all microtasks are handled, it
          moves to the callback queue and processes one task at a time.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If the
          stack is empty, the event loop picks the first task from the microtask
          queue (e.g., resolved Promises) and executes it. The event loop
          repeats this process, ensuring JavaScript remains responsive.

        <Typography>
          Scope is a fundamental concept in programming languages that underpins

          programming languanges.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables,
          functions, and other declarations in a programming language. It
          determines how a variable, function, or other entity can be accessed
          and used within different parts of a program.
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          At its core, scope in JavaScript refers to the context or environment
          in which variables are declared and can be accessed. It dictates the
          visibility and lifetime of a variable, determining where in your code
          a particular variable is valid and accessible.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>

          <Typography mode="gradient">Global Scope</Typography>
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          In JavaScript, global scope is the widest scope available. Variables
          declared in global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code,
          whether it's inside functions, conditional statements, loops, or other
          blocks of code. You can think of global scope as the "public square"
          of your program, where everyone can see and access what's going on.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Everything you declare in global scope is like putting up a billboard
          in the square for everyone to see. Any function or code block within
          your program can read and modify these global variables.
        </Typography>

        <Typography mode="h6">
          <Typography mode="gradient">Local Scope</Typography>
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Local scope in JavaScript is like a private room within a building â€“
          it's an enclosed space where variables are only accessible from within
          that specific room. When you declare a variable in local scope, it is
          limited in visibility to the block of code, function, or conditional
          statement in which it is defined.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Let's say you've declared variables in a function or block, now every
          time the function is called or the block is executed, new instances of
          these variables are created. This provides some isolation between
          functions. Each function call acts in its own little world (it's local
          environement) and can often be understood without knowing a lot about
          what's going on in the global environment.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Local scope has Two variation. Now Let's have a look at those...
        </Typography>
        <Typography mode="h6">
          <Typography mode="gradient">Function Scope</Typography>
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Function scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of
          variables, functions, and other declarations within a function. It
          determines how a variable, function, or other entity can be accessed
          and used within the function's body.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Wait a minute that's a bit of hard word there... So simply, a function
          scope is a local scope within a function. Variables declared within a
          function are only accessible within that function, and cannot be
          accessed from outside the function. The parameters of a function is
          also included in that functions scope.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mode="h6">
          <Typography mode="gradient">Block Scope</Typography>
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Block scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables,
          functions, and other declarations within a block of code, such as a
          loop or conditional statement. It determines how a variable, function,
          or other entity can be accessed and used within the block's body.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          That means if a variable is declared inside a loop or conditional
          statement, it is only accessible within that loop or conditional
          statement.{' '}

          JavaScript distinguishes not just the global and local bindings.
          Blocks and functions can be created inside other blocks and functions,
          producing multiple degree of locality. Let's have a look at an
          example...
        </Typography>
        <CodeSnippet>
          {`function outer(x){
            function inner(y){
              return x + y;
            }
            
            console.log(inner(2));
          }`}
        </CodeSnippet>
        <Typography>
          In the above code, the variable <Pill>x</Pill>is declared in the{' '}
          <Pill>outer</Pill>function's local scope. <Pill>y</Pill>is declared in
          the <Pill>inner</Pill>function's local scope. But if you look at the{' '}
          <Pill>inner</Pill> function, this function is using 2 variables{' '}
          <Pill>x</Pill>& <Pill>y</Pill>. So it will look for these variables
          inside it's own function scope, and it will not find the{' '}
          <Pill>x</Pill> inside it's own scope. So it will look into the scope
          above it which is in the outer function scope. Eventually it will find{' '}
          <Pill>x</Pill> there. If it doesn't find it even there.. then it will
          go find it one more step above, which is in this case the global
          scope. But for <Pill>y</Pill>it will find out in it's own scope.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          In short, each local scope can also see all the local scopes that
          contain it. The set of bindings visible inside a block is determined
          by the place of that block in the program text. Each local scope can
          also see all the local scopes that contain it, and all scopes can see
          the global scopes can see the global scope. This approach to bindings

          So, what is happening at the above code? Let's go through it step by
          step... First, There is a function declared named{' '}
          <Pill>wrapValue(n)</Pill>. Which takes a parameter <Pill>n</Pill>. it
          set's the value of <Pill>n</Pill>in it's local variable{' '}
          <Pill>local</Pill>and then returns a function. Now if we take a look
          at the function that is getting returned, we can see that it is
          returning the value of <Pill>local</Pill>. But there is no variable in
          it's Local scope called <Pill>local</Pill>. So it will take a look at
          the scope above and will find <Pill>local</Pill>in the{' '}
          <Pill>WrapValue()</Pill> funciton scope.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          In the next two following line, the <Pill>wrapValue(n)</Pill>function
          is called using <Pill>10</Pill> & <Pill>20</Pill>and the returned
          value is set in the <Pill>wrap1</Pill>and <Pill>wrap2</Pill>
          variable. Now what was the value that got returned from the function{' '}
          <Pill>wrapValue(n)</Pill>? It was a function, right? So{' '}
          <Pill>wrap1</Pill>and <Pill>wrap2</Pill>is basically function with the
          body that is returned from executed function <Pill>wrapValue(n)</Pill>
          .
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          Now in the next two line, we are showing the output of{' '}
          <Pill>wrap1()</Pill>and <Pill>wrap2()</Pill>in console. If you check
          the output it will print out <Pill>10</Pill>& <Pill>20</Pill>.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Wait a minute, but those values are from <Pill>wrapValue(n)</Pill>{' '}
          function which has already been executed. But the returned function
          still has access to it?{' '}
          <Typography mode="b-text">Yes, this is allowed and works</Typography>.
          Both instances of the bindings can still be accessed. This situation
          is a good demonstration of the fact that the bindings are created a
          new for every call, and different calls can't trample on one another's
          local bindings.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          This feature,{' '}
          <Typography mode="b-text">
            being able to access the outer function scope variable, even after
            the complete exectution of it's outer function, is called closure
          </Typography>
          . Another way to put it is, a{' '}
          <Typography mode="b-text">closure</Typography> is a function that "
          <Typography mode="b-text">remembers</Typography>" the variables from
          its lexical scope even after the outer function has finished
          executing. This powerful feature allows inner functions to access and
          manipulate variables defined in their outer function, even when the
          outer function is no longer active.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          There's 2 key points to be remembered about closure...
        </Typography>
        <AlertBox mode="info">
          The inner function retains access to the scope in which it was
          created.

          Variables declared in the outer function are preserved and not garbage

        </AlertBox>
        <Typography>
          Now Let's have a look at some of the use cases of closures using
          examples...
        </Typography>
        <CodeSnippet>
          {`function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: () => ++count,
    decrement: () => --count,
    getCount: () => count,
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter.increment()); // -> 1
console.log(counter.increment()); // -> 2
console.log(counter.getCount());  // -> 2
console.log(counter.decrement()); // -> 1`}
        </CodeSnippet>

        <AlertBox showIcon={false}>
          In the above code, what we achieved using closures is{' '}
          <Typography mode="b-text">Data Privacy</Typography>. The variable{' '}
          <Pill>count</Pill>is private and can only be accessed or modified
          using the methods provided by the closure.
        </AlertBox>
        <CodeSnippet>
          {`function multiply(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a * b;
  };

console.log(double(5)); // 10
`}
        </CodeSnippet>
        <AlertBox showIcon={false}>
          Closures can be used to create partially applied functions. That means
          we can create factory function. For example, we can create a another
          function using the above <Pill>multiply()</Pill>to create another
          function like to get the multiple of 3 for a number{' '}
          <Pill>tripple()</Pill>or multiple of 4 for a number{' '}
          <Pill>quadruple()</Pill>etc.
        </AlertBox>
        <CodeSnippet>
          {`function createLogger(name) {
  return function (message) {` +
            'console.log(`[${name}] ${message}`);' +
            `};
}

const appLogger = createLogger("Stupid App");
appLogger("Starting up..."); // [Stupid App] Starting up...
appLogger("Running smoothly..."); // [Stupid App] Running smoothly...

        </CodeSnippet>
        <AlertBox showIcon={false}>
          Closures can store information across multiple function calls. Like in
          the above code, we can store the name of the application in a closure
          variable and use it to log messages from different parts of the
          application.

        <AlertBox mode="info" className="font-bold text-md">
          NOTE: When a function is created, JavaScript maintains a reference to
          its lexical environment. The lexical environment contains:

            <ListItem>The function's local variables.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>References to variables in its parent scope.</ListItem>

          If the inner function (closure) is returned or assigned to another
          variable, the lexical environment remains in memory, allowing the

          Higher order functions are commonly used to compose multiple functions
          together to create more complex behaviors. They can also be used to
          implement higher-order components in React or other JavaScript

        <Typography mode="h5">Use Cases:</Typography>
        <Typography mode="h6">1. Callback Functions</Typography>
        <Typography>
          A <Typography mode="b-text">callback function</Typography> is a
          function passed as an argument to another function, where it is
          <Typography mode="b-text"> executed later</Typography> (often after an
          asynchronous operation or event). So, basically... When the higher
          order function get's function as an argument that function is called
          callback function or inshort callback.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Callbacks enable non-blocking behavior, event handling, and code
          reusability by allowing functions to delegate tasks or respond to
          outcomes. Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous
          programming to execute code after a task has completed. They are also
          used to implement event handlers in web applications.
        </Typography>
        <CodeSnippet>
          {`
          function simpleConsole(){
          console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
          }
          setTimeout(simpleConsole, 2000);
          `}
        </CodeSnippet>
        <AlertBox>
          In the above example, the function <Pill>simpleConsole</Pill>is a
          callback function because it is passed as an argument to another
          function. And the function <Pill>simpleConsole</Pill>is executed later
          after 2 seconds. So the <Pill>setTimeout()</Pill>function is a higher
          order function which utilizes callbacks to give us a way to execute
          asynchronous non-blocking operation.
        </AlertBox>
        <CodeSnippet>
          {`

        </CodeSnippet>
        <AlertBox>
          In the above example, <Pill>addEventListener</Pill>is a higher-order
